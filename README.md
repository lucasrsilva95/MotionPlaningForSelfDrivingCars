# MotionPlaningForSelf-drivingCars

This code was developed in the final project of the course "Motion Planing for Self-Driving Cars", that is the Fourth course of the Self-Driving Car Specialization offered by the University of Toronto.

The project goal was to develop the algorithms for the mission planning, behavior planning and local planning processes, necessary to gide the autonomous car through a road scene. The algorithm contains functions capable of controling the autonomous car in the processes of avoiding obstacles, following a lead vehicle and stopping at stop signs. The developed code was tested using the Carla Simulator.
